# gnb-spam-classifier

An experiment to build a Spam Classifier using sklearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes. Click [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html) to know more.

The dataset used for the classifier can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

The program is written in Python and _turned_ into a Web Application using __Flask__. You can find more information about how Flask works over [here](https://pythonhow.com/how-a-flask-app-works/)
* More specifically, I use the '''render_template''' method from the Flask class which returns HTML pages from a python script

The foundation, idea and knowledge of this program is from [this](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) __Udemy__ course.

You can test the Spam Classifier over [here]().
